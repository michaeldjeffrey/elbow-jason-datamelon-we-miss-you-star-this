# @elbow-jason we miss you star this
Previous failed attempts have led us to vary our attack vectors.

History has looked at those who have tried and tried, and in the presence of noncommunicative results, 
lowered their heads and pressed on, with a kind of pity.
Usually rewarding them with a mesely :+1: emoji.

But they tell themselves, that's better than the crippling silence.
So they press on.
